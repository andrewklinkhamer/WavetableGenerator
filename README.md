   - Each waveform has **Start** and **End** sliders (0-100%)
   - Start: Weight in the first frame
   - End: Weight in the last frame (when morphing is enabled)

2. **Enable Morphing** (optional, on Settings tab)
   - Check **Enable Morphing** for smooth frame transitions
   - Select frame count: 1, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024
   - More frames = smoother evolution, larger file size

3. **Apply Effects** (optional)
   - **Effects tab:** Distortion, filters, bit crushing, wavefold, symmetry ops
   - **Spectral Effects tab:** Spectral decay, tilt, gate, phase randomization
   - See [Effects Guide](#-effects-guide) below

4. **Generate**
   - Click **Generate** (bottom right)
   - Choose save location
   - Your wavetable is created with an auto-generated descriptive name

#### **Batch Generation (Exploration & Discovery)**

1. **Select a palette** of waveforms (10-20 recommended)
   - Choose from multiple tabs for variety
   - **Start/End sliders define weight ranges**: Random generation picks a random weight between Start and End for each waveform
   - Example: Start=50%, End=100% means this waveform will always be used with medium-to-high intensity

2. **Set the range** (bottom right)
   - **Number:** Min-Max waveforms per table (e.g., "2-5")
   - This controls the complexity of each generated table

3. **Click Generate**
   - Choose output folder
   - Enter number of wavetables to generate (e.g., 100)
   - Generation runs in a background thread (UI remains responsive)

4. **Review results**
   - Each file has a unique name based on its content
   - Morphing and frame counts are randomized
   - Import your favorites to see exactly how they were made!

### Waveform Controls

Each waveform has:
- **Checkbox** - Enable/disable this waveform
- **Start Slider** - Amplitude/weight in starting frame (0-100%)
- **End Slider** - Amplitude/weight in ending frame (0-100%, used with morphing)

**Utility Buttons (bottom left):**
- **Select All** - Selects all waveforms on all tabs
- **Randomize** - Randomly selects 1-8 waveforms across all tabs and sets random slider values
  - Press again to clear and re-randomize
- **Clear All** - Unchecks all waveforms on all tabs
- **Reset Sliders** - Reset all sliders to 100% (keeps checkboxes)

**Output Controls (bottom right):**
- **Number** - Range for random generation (Min-Max waveforms)
- **Generate** - Create wavetable(s) or cancel ongoing generation
- **Exit** - Close application (settings auto-saved on exit)

## üéõÔ∏è Effects Guide

### PWM & Morphing (Effects Tab)

**PWM Duty Cycle (0-100%)**
- Controls pulse width for pulse-based waveforms
- 50% = square wave, other values create asymmetry
- Real-time slider label updates

**Morph Curve**
- **Linear** - Constant transition rate
- **Exponential** - Slow start, fast end (accelerates)
- **Logarithmic** - Fast start, slow end (decelerates)
- **S-Curve** - Smooth at both ends (sigmoid)
- **Smooth Step** - Very smooth acceleration/deceleration

### Distortion

**Types:**
- **Soft Clip** - Smooth saturation (tanh)
- **Hard Clip** - Brick-wall limiting
- **Tube** - Warm tube-style saturation
- **Foldback** - Wavefolding distortion

**Amount:** 0-100% intensity (uses 4x oversampling)

### Filters

**Low-Pass Filter**
- Cutoff: 100-20,000 Hz
- Removes high frequencies
- Good for warming or de-harshening

**High-Pass Filter**
- Cutoff: 20-2,000 Hz
- Removes low frequencies
- Good for thin/bright sounds or removing DC offset

### Bit Crushing

- **Bit Depth:** 1-16 bits
- Lower bits = more digital/lo-fi character
- Uses 4x oversampling to prevent aliasing
- Great for retro video game sounds

### Wavefold

- **Amount:** 0-100%
- Creates complex harmonics by folding the waveform
- Uses 4x oversampling for clean results
- Excellent for aggressive, metallic timbres

### Symmetry Operations

- **Mirror H** - Horizontal mirror (time symmetry)
- **Mirror V** - Vertical mirror (phase inversion)
- **Invert** - Invert waveform amplitude
- **Reverse** - Reverse time direction

**Tip:** Combine multiple symmetry ops for unique transformations!

### Spectral Decay (Spectral Effects Tab)

**Frequency-domain effect using FFT processing**

- **Amount:** 0-100% decay intensity
- **Curve:** 1.0-5.0 exponential curve shaping
  - 1.0 = Linear decay slope
  - 2.0+ = More aggressive high-frequency roll-off

**How it works:**
- Progressively attenuates higher frequencies using Fast Fourier Transform
- Creates dark, warm, vintage, or lo-fi characteristics
- Higher frequencies decay more than lower frequencies

**Use cases:**
- **Analog Warmth** - Simulate tape saturation or vintage gear
- **Distance Effect** - Make sounds seem farther away
- **Lo-Fi/Vintage** - Emulate old synthesizers or degraded recordings
- **Spectral Morphing** - Create evolving timbral changes across frames
- **Bass Enhancement** - Clean up high-frequency noise in bass patches

**Tip:** Combine with low-pass filtering for extreme darkening effects!

### Spectral Tilt (Spectral Effects Tab)

**Frequency-domain effect using FFT processing**

- **Amount:** -100% (bass cut) to +100% (treble cut)
- **0% = Flat response** (no change)
- **Negative values** = Cut bass, boost treble (brighter)
- **Positive values** = Boost bass, cut treble (darker)

**How it works:**
- Applies linear frequency slope across the spectrum
- Similar to professional "tilt EQ" found in mixing consoles
- One control for tonal balance adjustment

**Use cases:**
- **Quick Tonal Balance** - Adjust brightness with single control
- **Modern/Vintage Character** - Negative for modern/bright, positive for vintage/warm
- **Complement Spectral Decay** - Use together for complex frequency shaping
- **Mix Preparation** - Pre-shape wavetables for specific mix contexts

**Tip:** Start with small adjustments (¬±20-30%) for subtle but effective changes!

### Spectral Gate (Spectral Effects Tab)

**Frequency-domain effect using FFT processing**

- **Threshold:** 0-100% (percentage of maximum magnitude)
- **0% = No gating** (all frequencies pass)
- **High values** = Only loudest frequencies pass

**How it works:**
- Analyzes frequency content and removes bins below threshold
- Based on magnitude relative to the loudest frequency component
- Creates "sparser" spectra with fewer harmonics

**Use cases:**
- **Noise Reduction** - Remove low-level artifacts or noise floor
- **Harmonic Simplification** - Reduce number of partials for cleaner sound
- **Gritty Effects** - High thresholds (60-80%) create lo-fi character
- **Cleanup Chaos/Fractals** - Tame overly complex waveforms

**Tip:** Use low thresholds (5-15%) for transparent cleanup, high thresholds (50-80%) for creative effects!

### Phase Randomization (Spectral Effects Tab)

**Frequency-domain effect using FFT processing**

- **Amount:** 0-100% randomization intensity
- **0% = Original phase relationships**
- **100% = Completely randomized phases**

**How it works:**
- Preserves magnitude spectrum (frequency content)
- Randomizes phase relationships between harmonics
- Changes waveform shape while maintaining timbre

**Use cases:**
- **Create Variations** - Generate unique waveforms from existing ones
- **Batch Generation** - Add unpredictability to random wavetables
- **Sound Design Exploration** - Discover unexpected timbres
- **Break Up Patterns** - Eliminate periodic artifacts or "phasiness"

**Why it's powerful:**
- Same frequency content, completely different waveform
- Used in professional synths (Serum, Vital, Pigments)
- Creates sounds impossible to achieve with time-domain effects
- Excellent for evolving/organic textures

**Tip:** Try 30-50% for subtle variation, 80-100% for radical transformation!

### Anti-Aliasing Technology

**PolyBLEP (Polynomial Band-Limited Step)**
- Applied to discontinuous waveforms (square, saw, pulse, triangle)
- Eliminates aliasing at waveform edges
- Preserves sharp transients without artifacts

**4x Oversampling**
- Used for all non-linear effects (distortion, bit crush, wavefold)
- Pushes harmonic content above Nyquist frequency
- Enables clean downsampling without aliasing

**Lanczos Windowed-Sinc Interpolation**
- High-quality resampling for oversampling

- Magnitude/phase representation for clean processing
- Automatic padding to power-of-2 for compatibility
- **4 spectral effects:** Decay, Tilt, Gate, Phase Randomization
- **Enhanced import analysis:** Spectral matching for better accuracy

### Effect Processing Chain

Effects are applied in this order:
1. Base waveform generation (with PolyBLEP if needed)
2. Waveform blending/mixing
3. DC offset removal
4. **Symmetry Operations** (reverse, mirror, invert)
5. **Non-Linear Effects** (distortion, wavefold, bit crush - with 4x oversampling)
6. **Time-Domain Filtering** (high-pass and/or low-pass)
7. **Spectral Effects** (spectral decay, tilt, gate, phase randomization - FFT processing)
8. **Global Normalization** (preserves relative amplitudes)

**Note:** Order matters! Spectral effects process after filtering, allowing complex frequency shaping. Phase randomization applies last for creative variation.

### Normalization Strategy

**Global Normalization**
- Analyzes peak amplitude across ALL frames
- Normalizes entire wavetable to this peak
- **Preserves relative amplitude relationships**
- Maintains smooth morphing without volume jumps

This is superior to per-frame normalization which would destroy morphing dynamics.

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Sound Design Tips

**For Clean, Musical Sounds:**
- Use morphing with 256+ frames
- Keep max harmonics at 6-8
- Apply effects subtly (20-40% range)
- Start with basic waveforms and add complexity

**For Experimental/Aggressive Sounds:**
- Use chaos theory or fractal waveforms
- Push distortion and wavefold to 80%+
- Combine inharmonic series with modulation
- Use extreme bit crushing (1-4 bits)

**For Vintage/Lo-Fi Character:**
- Enable spectral decay with 40-70% amount
- Use curve values of 1.5-2.5 for natural roll-off
- Add spectral tilt (+30% to +60%) for extra warmth
- Combine with soft clipping for tape-like saturation
- Try bit crushing (8-12 bits) with spectral effects for retro digital character

**For Unique/Experimental Sounds:**
- Use phase randomization (50-100%) on familiar waveforms
- Combine spectral gate (40-60%) with phase randomization
- Stack multiple spectral effects for complex processing
- Try spectral tilt extremes (¬±80-100%) for radical tonal shifts

**For Evolving Pads:**
- Enable morphing with 512+ frames
- Use asymmetric start/end sliders (e.g., 100% start, 30% end)
- Try S-Curve or Smooth Step morph curves
- Combine harmonic and vowel formants

**For Bass Wavetables:**
- Keep max harmonics low (4-6)
- Use basic waveforms (sine, triangle, saw)
- Apply subtle soft clipping
- Avoid high-pass filtering
- Use spectral decay (10-30%) to tame harsh high frequencies without losing punch

### Workflow Tips

**Discovery Mode:**
1. Select 15-20 diverse waveforms
2. Set Number range to 3-6
3. Generate 100 wavetables
4. Audition in your synth, keep 10-20 favorites
5. Import favorites to see how they're made
6. Tweak and regenerate refined versions

**Precision Mode:**
1. Start with 1-2 waveforms
2. Set sliders to specific values
3. Enable morphing with 256 frames
4. Generate and test
5. Import to verify, adjust if needed
6. Add effects incrementally

**Batch Library Creation:**
1. Create genre-specific folders (Bass, Leads, Pads, FX)
2. Select appropriate waveform palettes for each
3. Generate 50-100 per category
4. Organize by timbre characteristics
5. Create preset folders in your synth

### Performance Tips

- Large batch generations (500+) may take several minutes
- UI remains responsive - you can browse tabs during generation
- Click Generate (now "Cancel") button to stop at any time
- Settings auto-save, so feel free to close and resume later

### Avoiding Common Issues

**Aliasing:**
- Keep max harmonics ‚â§ 8
- Test at high pitches (C6+)
- Reduce effect intensity if artifacts appear
- Use soft clip instead of hard clip

**File Compatibility:**
- Use `.wt` format for Surge, Bitwig, Vital
- Use `.wav` if your synth prefers WAV files
- 256 frames is the most compatible frame count
- 2048 samples/frame is universal standard

**Import Accuracy:**
- Analysis uses spectral matching (frequency-domain comparison)
- More accurate than time-domain correlation for harmonically rich waveforms
- Phase-independent matching (better for processed/filtered wavetables)
- Use as starting point, not exact recreation
- Some commercial wavetables use proprietary techniques
- Combine analysis with your own adjustments and effects

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Q: Wavetable loads but makes no sound**  
‚úì Verify file format matches synth requirements (`.wt` vs `.wav`)  
‚úì Check wavetable isn't silent (use Audio Preview)  
‚úì Ensure synth's wavetable oscillator is enabled  
‚úì Try generating a simple sine wave to test  
  
**Q: I hear clicking or pops**  
‚úì This is aliasing - reduce max harmonics to 6-8  
‚úì Lower distortion or wavefold amount  
‚úì Use soft clipping instead of hard clipping  
‚úì Enable morphing for smoother frame transitions  
  
**Q: Sound is too quiet**  
‚úì This is normal due to global normalization  
‚úì Increase gain in your synth or mixer  
‚úì Use fewer waveforms or higher slider values  
‚úì Global normalization prevents clipping but reduces peak level  
  
**Q: Generation is stuck/frozen**  
‚úì Check progress bar - large batches take time  
‚úì UI should remain responsive (try clicking tabs)  
‚úì Click "Cancel" button to stop generation  
‚úì If truly frozen, close app and restart (settings are auto-saved)  
  
**Q: Import analysis doesn't match original**  
‚úì Analysis uses correlation (finds *similar*, not exact)  
‚úì Some wavetables use techniques not in our library  
‚úì Use as starting point and refine manually  
‚úì Try analyzing different frames - later frames may match better  
  
**Q: Random generation creates similar files**  
‚úì Increase your waveform palette (select more waveforms)  
‚úì Adjust Number range for more variety  
‚úì Generator checks for duplicates and skips them  
‚úì If still an issue, reduce batch size  
  
**Q: Application won't start**  
‚úì Ensure Windows 10 or later (64-bit)  
‚úì Install Visual C++ Redistributable (2022)  
‚úì Check if antivirus is blocking the .exe  
‚úì Try running as administrator  
  
**Q: Settings aren't saving**  
‚úì Check if `WavetableGenerator.ini` exists next to .exe  
‚úì Ensure folder is writable (not in Program Files)  
‚úì Settings save automatically on normal exit  
‚úì Force-closing may prevent save - use Exit button
